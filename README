This project delves into the concept of prompt engineering, a crucial aspect of AI that guides AI models to produce desired outputs. It's instrumental in AI tools like chatbots, text summarizers, and content generators, ensuring they communicate accurately, relevantly, and creatively. The project underscores the benefits of prompt engineering in business, from enhancing chatbot performance to guiding personalization systems, enabling accurate sentiment analysis, and optimizing productivity. It emphasizes the importance of clear instructions, examples, keywords, and feedback when working with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The project also outlines various techniques, including writing clear instructions, giving the model time to "think", and strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting and Generated Knowledge Prompting. We also introduce Langchain library that can provide strong tools for prompt engineering.
